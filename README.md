# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:** 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help the company to better prepare for when a large number of employees reach their retirement age at the same time.
    
 **Results:**

- First we created a 'Retirement titles' table to pull all retirement-age employees.

- Then by creating a 'Unique titles' table we removed the duplicates so only the most recent job titles are left. 

- By creating a table for employees by their most recent job title and grouping the output by the title we know which positions will need to be filled first and therefore we can start a hiring process ahead of time. 

- By creating a mentorship eligibility table we know who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program so we can also start working with them.


	According to the results and information gathered in the “Retiring Titles” table  we'll need to focus on hiring and training Senior Engineerings and Senior Staff the most.

**Summary:** 
  
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact the company will need to fill 41, 380 roles.

Mentorship eligibilty table shows that there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in different demperaments to start mentoring next  generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
